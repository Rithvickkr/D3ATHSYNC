Welcome to AR Warfare, an exhilarating augmented reality (AR) deathmatch game that transforms your surroundings into a tactical battlefield! Built with cutting-edge web technologies, this two-player, real-time shooter uses PoseNet for body tracking and WebGL for immersive AR visuals. Face off against an opponent in a high-stakes duel, where precision, strategy, and quick reflexes determine the victor.
üéÆ Game Overview
AR Warfare is a browser-based, multiplayer AR game where two players engage in a head-to-head deathmatch. Using a webcam and TensorFlow.js with PoseNet, the game tracks players' body movements to detect hits, overlaying a virtual crosshair and combat HUD on the real-world video feed. Choose from three distinct weapons, aim carefully, and outmaneuver your opponent to claim victory.
Key Features

Augmented Reality Combat: Experience real-time AR with a video feed overlaid by a 3D crosshair and tactical HUD, powered by Three.js.
PoseNet Hit Detection: Uses machine learning to track head, torso, and lower body for precise hit detection, with varying damage based on hit location and weapon type.
Multiplayer Action: Supports two players via Socket.IO, with real-time health updates and game state synchronization.
Weapon Variety: Select from three weapons with unique characteristics:
Sniper Rifle: High damage (40 for headshots), long range, smaller hit radius, 400ms cooldown.
Tactical Pistol: Medium damage (20 for headshots), close range, 200ms cooldown.
Combat Shotgun: Extreme damage (20 for headshots), close range, larger hit radius, 600ms cooldown.


Immersive Audio: Gunshot and hit sound effects enhance the combat experience.
Responsive UI: Sleek, futuristic HUD with health bars, weapon status, and countdown timers, optimized for both desktop and mobile.
Camera Selection: Choose from available webcams for the best AR experience.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run AR Warfare locally or deploy it to a server.
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)
npm or yarn
A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) with webcam access
An internet connection for multiplayer functionality

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ar-warfare.git
cd ar-warfare


Backend Setup:

Navigate to the backend directory (e.g., server/):cd server
npm install


Start the backend server:npm start

The server runs on http://localhost:3001 by default.


Frontend Setup:

Navigate to the frontend directory (e.g., client/):cd client
npm install


Start the frontend development server:npm run dev

The frontend runs on http://localhost:3000 by default.


Audio Files:

Ensure audio files (sniper.mp3, pistol.mp3, shotgun.mp3, hit.mp3) are placed in the frontend's public/ directory.


Environment Configuration:

For production, update the allowedOrigins array in the backend (server/index.js) with your deployed frontend URLs.
Update the Socket.IO connection URL in the frontend (client/src/components/Game.tsx) to point to your backend server (e.g., https://your-backend-server.com).



Deployment

Backend: Deploy to a service like Render or Heroku. Ensure the PORT environment variable is set.
Frontend: Deploy to Vercel or Netlify. Update the backend URL in the frontend code.
HTTPS: Use HTTPS for webcam access in production (required by browsers).

üé• Gameplay

Joining the Game:

Open the game in a browser and grant webcam access.
Select a camera and weapon, then click "Enter Ready State" to prepare for combat.
Wait for a second player to join and ready up.


Combat:

Once both players are ready, a 5-second countdown begins.
Use your webcam to aim by moving your body or the camera. The crosshair indicates your targeting area.
Press the "FIRE" button to shoot, with cooldowns based on your weapon.
Hits are detected on the opponent's head, torso, or lower body, with damage varying by hit location and weapon.


Winning:

Reduce your opponent's health to 0 to win.
The game ends with a victory or defeat screen. Click "New Mission" to reset and play again.
